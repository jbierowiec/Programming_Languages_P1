# Programming_Languages_P1

## Overview

The **Programming_Languages_P1** is a Python and C++ project that provides detailed information about the planets, moons, and the sun in our solar system. The project is implemented using a combination of procedural programming for C++ and object-oriented programming (OOP) for Python principles to organize and present data about celestial bodies.

## Features

- Retrieve essential details about planets, moons, and the sun, including volume, radius, diameter, circumference, orbital period, and distance from the sun.
- Organize and manage celestial bodies through a structured class hierarchy.
- Leverage procedural programming for efficient data retrieval and processing.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following modules:

1. **JSONPlain.txt** is a TXT file that contains information that is read in, in the oop.py file to generate the information of planets.

2. **oop.py**: This file is used to demonstrate the OOP process of displaying the planetary information.

3. **procedural.cpp**: This file is used to demonstrate the Procedural process of displaying the planetary information.

## Dependencies

The project has no external dependencies, making it easy to set up and use.
